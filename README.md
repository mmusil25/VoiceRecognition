## Project Description

For the Portland State University pre-capstone class (ECE 411) the team designed a voice-activated lockbox that can be used to protect belongings. Using the open source [speech-to-text library uSpeech] (https://github.com/arjo129/uSpeech) an AtMega32U4 was programmed to activate a solenoid in response to the diction of a password ("shore"). The potential market for such a product is adolescents with small belongings such as jewelry or diaries that they wish to protect.
